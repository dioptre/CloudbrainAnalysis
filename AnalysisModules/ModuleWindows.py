"""
The Windows Module is meant for bounding raw EEG data into epochs.
The current implementation is a "rolling" window of fixed width.  This is typically used in the testing or "online"
usage of BCI.  This type of window is characterized by a fixed width, and an overlap parameter. The idea is that, as
live data is coming in, you are constantly checking it against a trained model. This could also be used as a sort of
simple buffering on raw data, if you set the overlap to 0 for example.

        Windows Module chops streaming multi-channel time series data into 'windows'

        As matrix, window has dimensions [rows, cols] - standard notation for numpy, matlab, etc
