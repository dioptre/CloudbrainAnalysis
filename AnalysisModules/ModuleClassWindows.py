"""
The ClassWindows Module is meant for bounding raw EEG data into epochs by class label.

This module performs the kind of windowing used in training phase.  In this scenario, the goal is to collect windows
in which every datum belongs to the same class label.  This depends upon two inputs:

inputs:
    data:
        name: "eeg2"
        message_type: "JSON"
        data_type: "EEG_RAW"
    labels:
        name: "motor_class"
        message_type: "JSON"
        data_type: "CLASS_LABELS"

These must be named "data" and "labels" (deosn't matter what order), and they should both be of message_type JSON.

One key consideration when merging two input streams is that each is streaming from an asynchronous thread.  They are
almost certainly guaranteed to be out of synch with each other, especially when you take into account different output
frequency and different output buffers.  However, since both of these streams include timestamps on data, and the
timestamps are relative to a universal reference (system clock), we have an opportunity to resynchronize the streams
as we merge.

The way it works is like this: as raw EEG comes in, we simply collect it in a growing matrix.  When a class label
arrives, if it the same as the last class label, we just keep collecting.  If it is different, this is a signal that
it's time to cut off the current epoch and begin the next one, since epochs are grouped by class label.

To do this, we look at the timestamp of the new incoming class label, to see where the cutoff point will be on the
window we've collected so far.  Then, using that time marker, we slice the old data, label with the old class, and
deliver it.  The remainder becomes the new accumulator window, to be used with the new class label.
